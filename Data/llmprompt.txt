My JobSystem is a custom build concurrency program that will try compiling a program, parse the error and eventually output the error message thown by the compiler. The error message outputs each individual errors and warnings, containing the file and the line and column in the file which the error occured in, the error/warning message and eventually the snippet of code the error occured in. I want you to examine each error, and give me a debug solution for each every single error and warning. First, give an explanation of why the file did not compile, and second give the fixed code in the context of the error. For each error/warning, I want you to ouput why the compiler error/warning exist, what is the fix, and finally the code snippet that corrects the code where the error is at. 

Here is the error message:
Compiler error #1 in file ./Code/lib_job_system/samplecode/cat.h at line 7 and column 10. Compiler message prints:  error: extra qualification on member 'Cat'The context of the code is: class Cat : Animal
